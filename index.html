  <h1>Map</h1>

   <div id="1">
     <h3>1. Projection</h3>
     <ul>
       <li>The designer may try to build a 100% accurate representation of a globe.</li>
       <li>However, when you are making a globe, or a portion of it, fit into a flat picture,
       </br >
         some features will always be distorted: some distances, shapes, and area will be stretched, and others will be compressed. </li>
       <li>There are five properties that can be distorted when project a globe on flat surface: shape, area, angles, distance, and direction.</li>
       <li>At least three attributes will be sacrificed regardless of the projection you choose. Creating a flat map is a trade-off. </li>
     </ul>
  </div>

    <div id="2">
      <h3>2. Size Circles</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>The designer usually can not size circles correctly.</li>
        <li>For example, there is a circle A representing 100, and we want to obtain another circle B representing 200.
        </br >
        Many designers may just duplicate the circle A and scale it 200 percent to get circle B, but it is totally wrong. </li>
        <li>The software tool will make it twice as tall and twice as wide. Each circle isnâ€™t double the size the previous one, but four times its size.
        </br >
        What the designer did was to double the diameter, but that quadrupled.</li>
      </ul>
     </div>

    <div id="3">
      <h3>3. Software Defaults</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>The designer may rely too much on software defaults.</li>
      </ul>
     </div>
